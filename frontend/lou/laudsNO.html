		You have preserved my life<br>

		For it is not the nether world that gives you thanks,<br>

		Bring me back, let me come back, for you are the Lord, my God. For after I turned away, I repented;
		after I came to myself, I struck my thigh; I was ashamed, even humiliated, because I bore the disgrace of my youth.
